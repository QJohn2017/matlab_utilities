# matlab_utilities

In this repo you can find a few matlab utilities useful for data analysis and simulations.

 ## files:
   - adaptive      - adaptive evaluation a matlab function on a given range (useful for time consuming functions)
   - clamp         - replaces elements outside boundaries with minVal or maxVal
   - fitGaussian2D - automatically fit a bidimensional Gaussian surface, without need of setting initial parameters
   - pcol          - an improved pcolor which works with tensors
   - sampleCurve   - resamples a curve at equidistant points
