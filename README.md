# matlab_utilities

In this repo you can find a few matlab utilities useful for data analysis and simulations.

 ## files:
   - adaptive      - adaptive: evaluates a matlab function on a given range
   - clamp         - replaces elements outside boundaries with minVal or maxVal
   - fitGaussian2D - fits a bidimensional Gaussian surface
   - pcol          - is an improved pcolor which works with tensors
   - sampleCurve   - samples a function at equidistant points
   - centOfMass2d   - centOfMass2d calculates center of mass of an image
   - fftRange       - gives the circular domain of a fft
   - ndDetrend      - generalizes detrend to multi-dimensional arrays
   - nmax           - nmax gives the maximum of sevaral variables
   - round2multiple - rounds to the closest multiple of a unit
   - nmin           - nmin gives the minumum of sevaral variables
   - roundeven      - rounds x to the nearest even number
   - skewness2d     - SKEWNESS2d calculates skewness of an image
